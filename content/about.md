My name is Etai Even-Zahav. I am a furniture and cabinet maker based in Cambridge, UK. I make one-off and very small batch heirloom pieces, prospective and commissioned.

I draw inspiration from the arts & crafts and studio craft movements, as I hand-craft as much of each piece as possible, while carefully 'reading' each plank of rough-sawn timber, and embracing what it wants to become... 

I combine modern and traditional techniques and materials to achieve this, using and working with the wood to ensure its natural properties are accounted for in every design decision.

Even-Zahav Furniture is a family-run cabinet making business specializing in custom woodwork and fine furniture. Our passion is creating beautiful, functional pieces for your home or office.
